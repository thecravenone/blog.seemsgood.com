[[Changelog]](#changelog)

In each section, podcasts appear roughly by ranking of what percentage of the episodes that are released that I listen to, which I think is a pretty good proxy for which ones I like the most.

# General Interest

* [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/) - Design is all around us and we don't notice most of it. It is, as the title implies, mostly invisible. Each episode delves into the design of something encountered in everyday life.
* [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab/) - Primarily focusing on philosophical and scientific topics, this show tries to take complex topics and express them in simple terms without taking itself too seriously. _Radiolab_ has won two Peabody Awards and earned one of its creators a MacArthur grant.
* [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/) - Multiple "acts" telling different stories all with the same theme. Warning: This one can get pretty heavy and may result in ugly tears.

# Current Events

* [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/) - Each week, a different facet of the economy explained in easy to understand terms. Most (but not all) topics are news related.
* [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/archive/) - From the writers of _Freakonomics_, discussion of socioeconomics in easy to understand terms. Many (but not all) topics are news related. Similar to _Planet Money_ but generally dives a bit deeper.
* [The Indicator from Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/567724614/the-indicator) - From the makers of _Planet Money_ A short daily podcast that takes a single number of term from the news and places it in the context of the economy.

* [The Shutdown Fullcast](https://www.bannersociety.com/pages/welcome-to-the-shutdown-fullcast) - A very funny cast of hosts disuss college football and really whatever else they feel like.

* [Screaming in the Cloud](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/) - Corey Quinn talks with expert of various aspects of cloud computing. Usually not overly technical and more about how people think about things.

# Comedy

* [No Such Thing As A Fish](http://qi.com/podcast/) - The researchers from BBC Two's _QI_ present their favorite facts that they've discovered this week.

# History

Listen while you can - old episodes are taken off the feed and placed for sale on his website.
