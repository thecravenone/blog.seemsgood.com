Last updated 2025-10-15 [Changelog](#changelog)

In each section, podcasts appear roughly by ranking of what percentage of the episodes that are released that I listen to, which I think is a pretty good proxy for which ones I like the most.

# Current Events

* [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/) - Each week, a different facet of the economy explained in easy to understand terms. Most (but not all) topics are news related.
* [The Indicator from Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/567724614/the-indicator) - From the makers of *Planet Money* A short daily podcast that takes a single number of term from the news and places it in the context of the economy.
* [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/archive/) - From the writers of *Freakonomics*, discussion of socioeconomics in easy to understand terms. Many (but not all) topics are news related. Similar to *Planet Money* but generally dives a bit deeper.

# Sports

* [30 For 30 Podcasts](https://30for30podcasts.com/) - Audo documentaries from the makers of the award-winning film series *30 for 30*.

# Comedy

* [No Such Thing As A Fish](http://qi.com/podcast/) - The researchers from BBC Two's *QI* present their favorite facts that they've discovered this week.

# History

* [Dan Carlin's Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) - Historical deep dives - prepare to spend hours on a single event, excellently prepared to keep you listening to whole time. Listen while you can - old episodes are taken off the feed and placed for sale on his website.

# General Interest

* [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/) - Design is all around us and we don't notice most of it. It is, as the title implies, mostly invisible. Each episode delves into the design of something encountered in everyday life.
* [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab/) - Primarily focusing on philosophical and scientific topics, this show tries to take complex topics and express them in simple terms without taking itself too seriously. *Radiolab* has won two Peabody Awards and earned one of its creators a MacArthur grant.
* [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/) - Multiple "acts" telling different stories all with the same theme. Warning: This one can get pretty heavy and may result in ugly tears.

# Podcasts that completed their run

These are podcast that tell a complete story. Otherwise-ended podcasts in the changelog.

* [The Dropout](https://abcradio.com/podcasts/the-dropout/) - The story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos. The worldâ€™s youngest self-made female billionaire, once heralded as the next Steve Jobs, lost it all and is now facing criminal charges.
* [Missing Richard Simmons](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/missing-richard-simmons) - After decades in public life, Richard Simmons abrupty retires and cuts contacts with friends. A fromer friend investigates what's happening.
