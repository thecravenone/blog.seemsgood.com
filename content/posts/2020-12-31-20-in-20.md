When I made this post [last year](../nineteen-pictures-from-2019-2/), I decided not to caption any of the images. I felt that most of them provided enough of their own context - me in front of the New York skyline or at a concert doesn't require much information to understand. With _these unprecedented times_â„¢, I thought the pictures might require a bit more explanation. A version of this page with captions may be found [[HERE]](/pages/twenty-pictures-from-2020-with-captions/).
