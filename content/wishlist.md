# Kitchen and Bar Stuff

* Reusable chopsticks
* Bread baking tools (loaf pans, bannetons, baguete couches)
* Mandolin (the kind with a blade, not the kind with strings that makes music)
* Pretty much any barware from [Surfside Sips](https://www.surfsidesips.com/) or [Viski](https://viski.com/)

# Clothes

* Aloha shirts from Hawaiian companies. The following summarizing some brands from a Hawaiian friend:
	* [Kahala](https://kahala.com/) - The brand standard of aloha shirts worn by professionals on the islands
	* [Kamehameha](https://kamehamehagarments.com/) also a good option
	* [Hilo Hattie](https://hilohattie.com/) a good bang-for-the-buck option, not as formal as Kahala
	* [Tori Richard](https://toririchard.com/) offers a made in Hawaii collection and is also the manufacturer of Costco's aloha shirts

(Yes, I know some of these links are dead :/ )

* A print of [this photo](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/01/26/Local/Images/phsnow1_1296080101.jpg&w=1484). This is from an old article, so you'll have to contact WaPo [HERE](http://washingtonpost.mycapture.com/mycapture/photoRequestForm.asp). The original link is [HERE](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/26/AR2011012608076.html) which should make it easy for them to locate the file for you.

## Music

My current record collection may be found [[here]](https://www.discogs.com/user/thecravenone/collection?page=1&limit=250&sort=artist&sort_order=asc) and gives an idea what type of stuff I like. Buying from a local record shop is best. For old records online, check out [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) or [eBay](https://www.discogs.com/). For newer stuff, artist websites are most likley to have things in stock. The usual online shops may be cheaper. [Target](https://www.target.com/c/vinyl-records-music-movies-books/-/N-yz7nt?Nao=0) and [Urban Outfitters](https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/vinyl-records) often have exclusive special editions.

As I'm often adding things to my vinyl wishlist (or removing them as they join my collection) I have a dedicated vinly wishlist [[HERE]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HtYVvIFC2APXlutaUK3FbLHXgFjVIlThuBT4Lu7Jlyw/edit?usp=sharing) .
